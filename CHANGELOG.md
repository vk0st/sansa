# Changelog

## 1.2.0 (Unreleased)

### Compatibility

- Python >=3.10, NumPy >=2.0.2, SciPy >=1.14.1, Numba >=0.65.1.
- scikit-sparse 0.5.x / SuiteSparse >=7.4: migrate symbolic analysis,
  permutation retrieval, factorization and LL export to the modern API.
- Return owned CSC matrices and retain explicit long-index ordering control.

### Execution

- ICF sorts retained coefficients only; all candidate diagonal updates, tie
  selection and shift retries remain unchanged.
- Exact ICF prescaling uses panels instead of a complete first Gram allocation.
- Reject raw ICF budgets below 2*n before allocating unsafe kernel buffers.
  The factorizer already enforces this minimum; normal model fits are unchanged.
- Model, factorizer and UMR share parallel compressed-axis norms/scaling without
  nnz-sized temporary buffers. CSC replacement preserves value dtype and
  accumulates offsets in int64.
- A fit-local residual cache recomputes columns changed by substitution or global
  pruning. `residual_cache=False` disables it. Global pruning still runs after
  every update; cached residual values are recomputed, not delta-accumulated.
- SciPy products are the default, replacing automatic MKL selection when installed.
  `SANSAConfig(..., backend="mkl")` explicitly selects
  the optional MKL backend with mixed-dtype handling and integer overflow checks.
- `forward(batch, dense=True)` allows a direct dense final MKL product; the default
  `forward(batch)` remains sparse.
- Sparse top-k uses a parallel bounded-heap kernel for float32/float64 predictions,
  returning sorted results directly. NumPy handles tied/nonfinite rows to retain
  the existing recommendation ordering.
  Short rows return available entries with `-1`/`-inf` padding instead of raising.

- The MKL extra installs the binding, not a platform-specific MKL runtime.
